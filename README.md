# Lightweight deep learning (1D CNN) using drag data for developmental delay


##### Architecutre
Multi-input (multi-modal) deep learning using game touch log.
This logs were extracted from DoBrain for children with developmental delay

##### Interpretation
We also included interpretation methods (partial grad-cam due to multi-inputs)
